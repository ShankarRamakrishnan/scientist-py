Create a new branch for your changes. It's best practice to give your branch a meaningful name:

## 5. Make Changes

Make your changes to the codebase. Be sure to add tests in `tests/` that validate your changes.

## 6. Run Tests

Before committing your changes, ensure that all tests pass:

```bash
pytest
```

## 7. Commit and Push Your Changes

Once you're happy with your changes, commit and push them to your fork:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 8. Open a Pull Request

Go to the original repository's Pull Requests tab, and open a new pull request from your fork's branch. Provide a clear description of the changes you made.

## 9. Review and Merge

Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
